# 🏠 House Price Prediction - Linear Regression

This repository contains my work for **Task 3** of the AI & ML Internship program. The objective of this task was to understand and implement **Simple and Multiple Linear Regression** using a real-world dataset.

---

## 📝 Task Objective

To build and evaluate a regression model to predict house prices using:
- Simple & Multiple Linear Regression
- Model training & testing
- Evaluation metrics (MAE, MSE, R²)
- Regression line plotting and interpretation

---

## 📂 Dataset

**Source:** [Housing Price Prediction Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harishkumardatalab/housing-price-prediction)

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## 🔍 Steps Performed

1. **Data Loading**  
   Loaded the dataset using Pandas.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**  
   Explored dataset structure, checked for null values, and data distribution.

3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values (if any)
   - Selected relevant features and target column

4. **Train-Test Split**
   - Split the dataset into 80% training and 20% testing data.

5. **Model Training**
   - Trained a Linear Regression model using `sklearn.linear_model`.

6. **Prediction & Evaluation**
   - Made predictions on test data.
   - Evaluated using MAE, MSE, and R² score.

7. **Visualization**
   - Plotted regression line (for simple regression)
   - Plotted residuals for multiple regression
